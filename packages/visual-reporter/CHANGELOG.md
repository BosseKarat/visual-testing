# @wdio/visual-reporter

## 0.1.7

### NEW PACKAGE

This is the first release of the new `@wdio/visual-reporter` module. With this module, in combination with the `@wdio/visual-service` module, you can now create beautiful HTML reports where you can view the results.

To make use of this utility, you need to have the 'output.json' file generated by the Visual Testing service. This file is only generated when you have the following in your configuration:

```ts
export const config = {
    // ...
    services: [
        [
            // Also installed as a dependency
            "visual-regression",
            {
                createJsonReportFiles: true,
            },
        ],
    ],
    },
}
```

For more information, please refer to the WebdriverIO Visual Testing [documentation](https://webdriver.io/docs/visual-testing).

#### Installation

The easiest way is to keep `@wdio/visual-reporter` as a dev-dependency in your `package.json`, via:
