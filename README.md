### Testing

Several tests need to be executed to be able to test the module. When adding a PR all tests must at least pass the local tests. Each PR is automatically tested against Sauce Labs, see [Travis-ci with Sauce Labs](./CONTRIBUTING.md#travis-ci-with-sauce-labs-not-needed-for-a-pr). Before approving a PR the core contributors will test the PR against emulators/simulators / real devices.

#### Local Testing

First, a local baseline needs to be created. This can be done with

```sh
// With the webdriver protocol
$ npm run test.local.init

// With the Chrome DevTools protocol
$ npm run test.local.dev.tools.init
```

This command will create a folder called `localBaseline` that will hold all the baseline images.

Then run

```sh
// With the webdriver protocol
npm run test.local.desktop

// With the Chrome DevTools protocol
$ npm run test.local.dev.tools.desktop
```

This will run all tests on a local machine on Chrome.

#### CI testing with Sauce Labs (not needed for a PR)

The command below is used to test the build on GitHub Actions, it can only be used there and not for local development.

```
$ npm run test.saucelabs
```

It will test against a lot of configurations that can be found [here](./tests/configs/wdio.saucelabs.conf.js).
All PRs are automatically checked against Sauce Labs.

## TODO:

-   [ ] fix the scrollbar for Android, sometimes it shows
-   [ ] create a new website
